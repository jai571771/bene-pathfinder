Benefits GPS — AI-Powered Welfare Scheme Eligibility Navigator

Benefits GPS is a multi-language, AI-assisted, Aadhaar-integrated welfare navigation platform designed to help Indian citizens — especially students, rural families, women, farmers, and persons with disabilities — automatically discover the schemes they are eligible for.

This project demonstrates how AI, automation, location services, and structured eligibility rules can transform access to government benefits at a national scale.

🌟 Why “Benefits GPS”? — The Meaning Behind the Name

Just like GPS guides people to the right destination,
Benefits GPS guides citizens to the right government benefits.

BENEFITS → Thousands of schemes exist, but people don’t know about them.

GPS → Navigates and reroutes intelligently.

Benefits GPS → Navigates users through the complex welfare ecosystem.

Our metaphor:
“A digital welfare navigator that finds your path — automatically.”
